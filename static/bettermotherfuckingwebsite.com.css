 *  - `background-color: #eeeeee`
 *     I would've even made this site's background a nice #EEEEEE
 *     if I wasn't so focused on keeping declarations to a lean 7 fucking lines.
 *  - `max-width: 550px`
 *     Keep it to a nice 60-80 and users might actually read
 *     more than one sentence of your worthless dribble.
 *
 * If you are the author of this CSS and this use bothers you, file an issue and
 * this CSS will be replaced, no questions asked. If you are offended by the use
 * of the word `fucking` in the css, write your own fucking hhvm documentation.
