        <h2>Why Do You Need This?</h2>
        <p>
          This is not your average "How to connect &lt;programming language&gt;
          to &lt;database&gt; in docker-compose.yml" blog post. No, this site
          explains you how to use HHVM without depending on Meta's builds from
          2022, which contain known security vulnerabilities. I have built
          Docker containers with hhvm@next. Compiling hhvm from source is no
          easy feat and I could not have done it without the help of
          <a href="https://github.com/mszabo-wikia" target="_blank"

        <h2>What Is HHVM?</h2>
        <p>
          The Hip Hop Virtual Machine, HHVM for short, is the runtime for the
          Hack programming language. In the 2010s, HHVM could also be used to
          run PHP code at blazing speeds. This is no longer supported. If you
          came here for a tutorial on how to speed up your PHP applications, I
          direct you to <a href="https://php.net" target="_blank">PHP.net</a>.

      <hgroup>
        <h2>What Is Hack?</h2>
        <p>
          Hack is a general-purpose programming language created at Meta. If you
          are interested in what Hack does well, you can read the
          <a href="https://hacklang.org/" target="_blank"
            >Hack user documentation</a
          >. In short, the Hack programming language is predominantly used on
          web servers to render dynamic pages or API responses for use in
          websites. The syntax looks like PHP, and that is on purpose. The
          facebook.com project has been incrementally migrated from PHP to Hack.
          Hack has diverged from PHP in some ways, but any PHP developer should
          still be able to pick up Hack in an afternoon and start hacking away.

        <h2>How to Install HHVM?</h2>
        <p>
          The
          <a
            href="https://docs.hhvm.com/hhvm/installation/introduction"
            target="_blank"
            >official installation instructions</a
          >
          are very outdated. They require you to run Ubuntu 20.04 Focal Fossa,
          which was released in 2020. You probably want to run something newer.
          I strongly recommend running HHVM in a Docker container, both on your
          developer machine and on your servers. I publish HHVM containers to
          <a
            href="https://hub.docker.com/u/hersheltheodorelayton"
            target="_blank"
            >Docker Hub</a
          >. These containers are much newer than the
          <a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/hhvm" target="_blank"
            >official containers</a
          >
          published by the HHVM Project.

            for dealing with all the difficult C++ and CMake problems. Without
            him, I could not build these containers.</i

          If you do not have Docker installed, follow the official

        <h2>Linux Kernel Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Before you start, you must check your Linux kernel version. You can do
          so using <code>uname -a</code>. If your kernel version is 6.9 or
          below, you need to upgrade your kernel. At the time of writing, both
          the latest Ubuntu LTS, 24.04 Noble Numbat, and the latest stable
          Debian release, Bookworm 12, do not ship with a 6.10 or greater
          kernel. On Ubuntu 24.04, you can install the
          <a href="https://ubuntu.com/kernel/lifecycle" target="_blank"
            >Hardware Enablement Stack</a
          >. On Debian 12, you can use the
          <a
            href="https://packages.debian.org/bookworm-backports/kernel-image"
            target="_blank"

        <h2>Development Environment</h2>
        <p>
          I recommend VS Code or any of its forks to anyone just starting out
          with Hack. I personally use VSCodium, a community-driven,
          freely-licensed binary distribution of Microsoft's editor VS Code.
          Install VS Code or one of its forks. Press
          <code>Ctrl+Shift+X</code> to open the Extensions pane. If this
          shortcut doesn't work, open the command palette and use
          <code>Extensions: Focus on Marketplace View</code>. Look for
          <code>pranayagarwal.vscode-hack</code>. Install this extension. If you
          are using a fork of VS Code, but not Visual Studio Code itself, search
          for
          <code>
            hershel-theodore-layton.dead-simple-lint-server-integration</code
          >. For Visual Studio Code users, download the VSIX from
          <a
            href="https://open-vsx.org/extension/hershel-theodore-layton/dead-simple-lint-server-integration"
            target="_blank"
            >OpenVSX</a
          >
          and install it manually using
          <code>Extensions: Install from VSIX</code>.

        <h2>Hello, World!</h2>
        <p>
          Let's create your first Hack program. Let's start with a bare project.
          I have created one here:
          <a
            href="https://github.com/hershel-theodore-layton/hhvm-docs/tree/master/example"
            target="_blank"
            >Example Project</a
          >. Copy this project into an empty directory. Now, let's start by
          running <code>docker compose up</code>. This will create a
          <code>.vscode</code> and a <code>vendor</code> directory for you. Your
          IDE will now request a restart. After the restart, you should see one
          problem in the <code>Problems</code> pane. This problem will guide you
          to <code>file.hack</code>.
          <i>file.hack(6, 44): This could be a single-quoted string.</i> Change
          the <code>"Hello, World!"</code> string to
          <code>"Hello, World!\n"</code> and this problem should go away. If it
          does not, do not worry; you can run the program regardless. Run
          <code>docker compose exec hhvm hhvm src/file.hack</code> from the same
          directory as your <code>Dockerfile</code>, and you will see
          <code>Hello, World!</code> printed to the console.

        <h2>What's Next?</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you have an Hello, World!, you can start developing a real
          application. For that, you will need some libraries. More on this
          soon.
